# Patent Kind Codes

Welcome to the Patent Kind Codes project! This repository is part of a series of open-source initiatives launched from [patent.dev](patent.dev/projects). My goal is to create and maintain a comprehensive, open-source resource listing patent kind codes, along with their meanings and the timeframes during which they were used. This resource aims to support developers, patent researchers, and analysts in better understanding and managing patent data.

## Project purpose

Patent kind codes can vary by country, by time period, and even by specific patent data sources. A well-maintained list of these codes, complete with detailed explanations and historical context, would make it easier for developers, researchers, and analysts to accurately interpret and utilize patent data. This project is designed to create that resource.

## Why is this repository empty?

To gauge community interest, I’m using GitHub stars and forks as indicators of demand:

- 100 Stars – If this repository reaches 100 stars, it will signal enough interest to justify starting the project.
- 10 Forks – When at least 10 users fork this repository, it shows there’s a group interested in contributing.

Once these thresholds are met, I’ll begin implementing the resource and updating the repository with our progress.

## How you can help

If this project sounds valuable to you, here’s how you can show your support:

- Star the Repository – Show your interest in seeing this project come to life.
- Fork the Repository – If you’re interested in contributing, please fork it! This will signal a readiness within the community to build this tool together.

Thank you for considering this project! With enough support, we can create a resource that benefits everyone working with patent data. For more project ideas, visit [patent.dev](patent.dev/projects).
